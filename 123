## **1(a) Characteristics of Research (5 marks)**

**Answer (write exactly like this):**

Research is a systematic and scientific process of investigating a problem to discover new knowledge or validate existing facts. It follows a structured methodology to ensure accuracy, reliability, and objectivity of results.

The important characteristics of research are:

1. **Systematic** – Research follows a well-defined sequence starting from problem identification, literature review, hypothesis formulation, data collection, analysis, and conclusion.
2. **Objective** – Research is unbiased and based on observable and measurable facts rather than personal opinions.
3. **Empirical** – Research conclusions are drawn from real-world data obtained through experiments, observations, or surveys.
4. **Logical** – Logical reasoning and scientific principles are used to derive valid conclusions.
5. **Replicable** – The research process and results can be repeated and verified by other researchers under similar conditions.
6. **Analytical** – Collected data is critically examined using statistical or computational techniques.
7. **Generalizable** – Research findings should be applicable beyond the specific sample studied.

## **1(b) Distinguish between Fundamental and Applied Research (5 marks)**

**Answer:**

Fundamental research and applied research differ based on their objectives and application.

| Fundamental Research                         | Applied Research                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Focuses on expanding theoretical knowledge   | Focuses on solving practical problems      |
| Concerned with basic principles and concepts | Concerned with real-world applications     |
| Results may not have immediate use           | Results have immediate practical value     |
| Mostly conducted in academic environments    | Commonly conducted in industry             |
| Example: Study of human sleep cycles         | Example: AI-based sleep disorder detection |

Thus, fundamental research builds the foundation of knowledge, while applied research uses that knowledge to solve specific problems.

## **1(c) Formulation of Research Hypothesis (5 marks)**

**Answer:**

A research hypothesis is a testable statement that predicts the relationship between variables.

**Problem Statement:**
Analysis of sleep quality using physiological and lifestyle data.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**
Machine learning models do not significantly improve the accuracy of sleep quality classification using physiological and lifestyle data.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**
Machine learning–based classification models can accurately classify sleep quality levels using multimodal physiological and lifestyle data.

The hypothesis provides a clear direction for data collection, model selection, and statistical validation.

## **1(d) Good Practices of Literature Survey (5 marks)**

**Answer:**

A literature survey is a critical step in research that helps understand existing work and identify research gaps.

Good practices include:

1. Referring to reliable and peer-reviewed sources such as IEEE, Springer, and Elsevier.
2. Studying recent research papers to understand current trends and advancements.
3. Categorizing literature based on methodologies, datasets, and performance metrics.
4. Identifying limitations and gaps in existing studies.
5. Comparing different approaches to justify the chosen methodology.
6. Maintaining proper citations to avoid plagiarism.
7. Summarizing findings systematically for clarity and future reference.

## **2(i) Abstract (≤ 300 words)**

**Exam-Perfect Abstract (you can write this directly):**

Sleep quality plays a crucial role in maintaining physical health, mental well-being, and cognitive performance. Traditional sleep assessment techniques such as polysomnography (PSG), although accurate, are expensive, intrusive, and unsuitable for continuous home monitoring. This has motivated the development of automated and non-intrusive sleep analysis systems using artificial intelligence.

This project proposes an AI-based framework for sleep quality analysis using multimodal physiological and lifestyle data. The dataset includes parameters such as sleep duration, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), body movement, stress levels, and demographic factors. Feature extraction is performed to capture meaningful sleep-related characteristics, and a Random Forest classification model is employed to categorize sleep quality into good, average, and poor.

Random Forest is chosen due to its ability to handle heterogeneous data, model non-linear relationships, and provide robustness against noisy physiological signals. Feature importance analysis further enhances model interpretability by identifying key factors influencing sleep quality. Experimental results demonstrate improved classification accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models.

The proposed system enables scalable, interpretable, and non-intrusive sleep quality assessment, making it suitable for long-term home-based monitoring and early detection of sleep-related health issues.

## **2(ii) Reference Paper and Methodology**

**Answer:**

**Reference Paper:**
Alshammari (2024), *“Machine learning techniques for sleep disorder classification”*

**Methodology Used in the Paper:**

* Collection of sleep and lifestyle datasets
* Data preprocessing and feature selection
* Application of classifiers such as KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ANN
* Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics

**Difference from Present Work:**

* The reference paper focuses on sleep disorder detection, whereas the present work focuses on sleep quality classification.
* The proposed work emphasizes interpretability through feature importance analysis.
* The present work targets home-based, non-intrusive sleep quality monitoring rather than clinical diagnosis.

## **2(iv) Algorithm Explanation – Random Forest**

**Answer:**

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that consists of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained using a random subset of the dataset and a random selection of features. This randomness ensures diversity among the trees.

When a new sleep data sample is provided, it is passed through all decision trees. Each tree independently predicts the sleep quality class. The final classification result is obtained using majority voting among all trees. This ensemble approach reduces overfitting and improves generalization performance.

Random Forest is well suited for sleep quality analysis because physiological data is multimodal, noisy, and non-linear. The algorithm can effectively handle mixed data types and provides feature importance scores, which help identify key physiological factors affecting sleep quality.
